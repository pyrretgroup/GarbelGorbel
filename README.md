# GarbelGorbel
quickly generate stylish reports for, well, whatever you want!
## Modes
GarbelGorbel can work in two modes:
- API Mode: Generate the report based on the request body and return the report or a url where the report is hosted.
- Local Mode: Generate reports by some other software on the same machine via the npm package. **COMING SOON** <br>

The easiest way to use garbelgorbel on the same machine is to use Local Mode. However, if your not using node, you can use API mode and send a request to yourself with `localhost`.
